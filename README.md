# Procare Activities Integration for Home Assistant

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant to display the latest activities from the [Procare Connect](https://procareconnect.com/) platform. It creates a sensor that shows the most recent activity for a selected child and stores all of today's activities in the sensor's attributes.

## Features

*   **Fetches Daily Activities:** Retrieves the latest activities for a selected child from the Procare Connect API.
*   **Real-time Sensor:** Creates a sensor entity in Home Assistant for the most recent activity. The sensor's state is the title of the latest activity (e.g., "Meal: Lunch").
*   **Detailed Attributes:** Stores all activities from the last 7 days in the sensor's attributes, including timestamps, details, photos, and staff member names.
*   **Multi-child Support:** If your account has multiple children, you can select which child to monitor during the configuration process.
*   **Custom School Support:** Supports Procare instances with custom school domains.

4.  **(Optional)** If your school uses a custom Procare domain (e.g., `myschool.procareconnect.com`), enter the school's unique name (e.g., `myschool`) in the "School Name" field. If you leave this blank, the integration will use the default Procare URLs.

## Sensor Usage

The integration creates a sensor named `sensor.<child_name>_activities`.

*   **State:** The state of the sensor will be the title of the most recent activity (e.g., "Nap Started at 1:00 PM").
*   **Attributes:** The sensor's attributes contain a list of all activities from the past 7 days. Each activity is a dictionary with the following keys:
    *   `id`: The unique ID of the activity.
    *   `timestamp`: The time the activity occurred (ISO 8601 format).
    *   `title`: A descriptive title for the activity.
    *   `details`: Additional details about the activity.
    *   `photo_url`: A URL to a photo associated with the activity (if available).
    *   `staff`: The name of the staff member who recorded the activity.

You can use this data to create automations or display it in your Home Assistant dashboard.
